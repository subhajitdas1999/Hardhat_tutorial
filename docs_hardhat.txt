Hardhat-ethers :- Injects ethers.js into the Hardhat Runtime Environment. ethers form hardhat is globally available

waffle :- Waffle is a framework for testing smart contracts that uses minimal dependencies, has syntax that is easy to learn and extend, and 
provides fast execution times when compiling and testing smart contracts. 
It is TypeScript compatible and uses Chai matchers to make tests easy to read and write.

@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle :-Adds a Waffle-compatible provider to the Hardhat Runtime Environment and automatically initializes the Waffle Chai matchers.

waffle chai matchers :- https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers.html (chai for ethereum)

in harhat config.js :- We're only requiring hardhat-waffle here because it depends on hardhat-ethers so adding both isn't necessary.
